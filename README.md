# Tic Tac Toe

## Inspired by YouTube videos regarding the Tic Tac Toe board game.
The programs assimilates the board game, consisting of user input in the terminal. Then, the user will get asked to type a number from 1 to 9 and,
depending on the number, the user will place a 'X' on the number, and the cpu will automatically place 'O' randomly.
The game board has three rows and three columns, each "slot" corresponding the numbers from 1 to 9. The program will ask the user to
put a number until the game ends in a win, defeat, or draw. Also, the user will play against the computer and this program can be
improved if AI is implemented. However, this is a simple program.
