# TicTacToe.java
My first project in Java, where I create a simple Tic Tac Toe game using user input.
The input consists of numbers, ranging from 1 to 9. This was inspired by YouTube videos and the purpose of
this is to learn to create projects on my own to further my knowledge in programming, whether
it is in Java, Python, C, or other programming languages that I'm interested to learn.
